This file contains the source code for 1590599063 Practical Web 2.0 Applications with PHP, by Quentin Zervaas

Each directory contains the application source code as it stands at the end of the given chapter.

Some chapters have additional listings that do not form part of the final application. These listings are in directories denoted with "-examples" at the end of the directory name.

NOTE: The application code for all chapters requires the Zend Framework. Only one copy has been included in this archive (in the Zend directory). You will need to copy this directory in the ./include directory for any given chapter.
